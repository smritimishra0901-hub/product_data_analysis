# 🛍️ Product Sales Analysis

## 📊 Overview

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on product sales data to discover trends, correlations, and insights.
It helps understand which products, regions, and time periods contribute most to total revenue and how sales patterns evolve over time.

## 🧠 Objectives

* Load and clean raw product sales data.
* Compute key metrics such as total sales, profit, and revenue distribution.
* Identify top-performing products and categories.
* Visualize sales trends across time, regions, and customer segments.
* Generate actionable insights to guide business strategy.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

* **Python 3.x**
* **pandas** — for data manipulation and analysis
* **numpy** — for numerical computation
* **matplotlib** and **seaborn** — for data visualization

## 📂 Data

The dataset typically contains:

* `Order ID`
* `Product`
* `Category`
* `Region` / `Country`
* `Quantity`
* `Sales`
* `Profit`
* `Order Date`

These columns are used to analyze performance, compute summary statistics, and visualize key patterns.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load and inspect the dataset.
3. Clean and preprocess data (handle nulls, formats, and data types).
4. Generate descriptive statistics.
5. Create visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, time-series plots).
6. Derive insights on product, region, and time-based performance.

## 📈 Output

* Graphs showing top products, profit distribution, and sales over time.
* Heatmaps for correlation between numeric variables.
* Summary tables of top categories and sales trends.
